# Hill_and_Valley_Predications_with_Logistic_Regression

This Python project showcases the application of logistic regression for predicting terrain formations, specifically hills and valleys. The logistic regression model is trained on a dataset containing various terrain-related parameters, enabling it to classify landscapes into either hills or valleys. The project provides an insightful exploration of how machine learning can be employed to analyze geographical features.

Key Features:
Logistic Regression Model: The project revolves around the implementation and training of a logistic regression model. This model is designed to predict whether a given terrain is a hill or a valley based on input features.
